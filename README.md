This program was created to be a digital ledger that allows the storing and categorization of all the money I personally make and spend, and save it in a database for logging purposes and visualization via the open source project Metabase.

This is meant only to run locally to help compensate for my lack of proper code/best practice knowledge. You should do the same.

The idea for this was based off of this linked google sheet/form. I was hoping for similar functionality, just fully self-hostable and private. https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/53ktyv/budget_spreadsheet_with_google_form_for_tracking/

This code was possible thanks to this Udemy course:

### ⭕ To do:
- Add user editable parent categories & child categories
- finalize bootstrap forms
- Add automatic database backup
- a working "delete last entry" button in case of incorrect input
- use of a global config.php file for global variables and database connection
- complete documentation & install/usage guide
